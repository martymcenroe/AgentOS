You are reviewing a Low-Level Design document for the {{PROJECT_NAME}} project.

**Context:** This is a ONE-SHOT REVIEW request via gemini-model-check.sh wrapper. You are running as gemini-3-pro-preview model. This is NOT an interactive session - no handshake required. Provide your review feedback immediately.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the three-tier priority system:
   - [BLOCKING] - Must fix before implementation (security, correctness, fail-safe gates)
   - [HIGH] - Should fix before implementation (testing, mocking, data pipeline)
   - [SUGGESTION] - Nice to have (performance, maintainability)
2. Do NOT offer to implement code or provide code snippets
3. Focus on design review only

REVIEW CHECKLIST:

## Tier 1: BLOCKING (Must Pass)
| Category | Key Questions |
| --- | --- |
| **Security** | Input validation? Injection risks? Auth/AuthZ? Secrets management? OWASP Top 10? |
| **Privacy** | PII handling? Logging sensitive content? Data minimization? |
| **Correctness** | Does implementation match requirements? Are interfaces correct? Edge cases handled? |
| **Control** | Does the test strategy rely on manual verification? Tests must be automated assertions. |
| **Fail-Safe** | Are timeout/failure paths explicitly defined? Is "Silent Failure" prevented? |

## Tier 2: HIGH PRIORITY (Should Pass)
| Category | Key Questions |
| --- | --- |
| **Testing** | All scenarios covered? Tests fail on revert? Data hygiene (no real sensitive data in tests)? |
| **Mocking** | Can this be developed offline? Is a "Mock Mode" defined for external dependencies? |
| **Data Pipeline** | Where does data come from? How does it get there? Test fixtures defined? |

## Tier 3: SUGGESTIONS (Nice to Have)
| Category | Key Questions |
| --- | --- |
| **Performance** | Latency budget? Memory budget? Bottlenecks identified? |
| **Maintainability** | Code structure clear? Future developers can understand? |
