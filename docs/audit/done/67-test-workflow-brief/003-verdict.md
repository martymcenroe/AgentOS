# Issue Review: Test Workflow End-to-End Issue Creation

## Identity Confirmation
I am Gemini 3 Pro, acting as Senior Technical Product Manager & Governance Lead.

## Pre-Flight Gate: FAILED

The submitted issue does not meet structural requirements for review.

### Missing Required Sections:
- [ ] User Story - No "As a user/developer, I want... So that..." statement found. (While "Objective" and "UX Flow" are present, the specific User Story format describing the actor and value proposition is missing).

**Verdict: REJECTED - Issue must include all required sections before review can proceed.**
