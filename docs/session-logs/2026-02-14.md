# AssemblyZero - Session Log 2026-02-14

## Session: CLAUDE.md audit + instruction chain optimization
- **Mode:** full cleanup
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Summary:** Comprehensive CLAUDE.md audit across 18 repos (issue #363). Removed ~1,100 lines of stale rules, redundant content, and heavyweight boilerplate. Fixed && ban contradicting system prompt. Removed 4 stale WORKFLOW.md sections. Instruction chain optimization: moved universal rules to Projects/CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded, zero tool calls). Removed "Read AssemblyZero/CLAUDE.md" from 11 project files. Simplified AssemblyZero CLAUDE.md to 10 lines.
- **Cleanup Actions:**
  - Deleted 5 merged remote branches (cleanup-audit-20260205-2250, dependabot-audit-20260205-2230, dependency-update-audit, final-dependency-update, fork-rename-agentos-to-assemblyzero)
  - No tmpclaude files found
  - No local orphaned branches to delete
  - 1 active worktree (fix-ci-pytest) with no associated PR - active development
- **Next:** Per user direction
