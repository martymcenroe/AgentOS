# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a solid foundation for per-repository state isolation, addressing the core issue of concurrency. The logic is sound and safety protocols (Fail Closed, Git Ignore) are largely in place. However, the document leaves a critical architectural dependency decision open and lacks necessary runtime observability for the path resolution. These must be solidified before coding begins.
