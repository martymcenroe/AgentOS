All 98 tests pass. The key fix was replacing the `test_anthropic_sdk_detected` test (which referenced `"anthropic"` — a key not in `FRAMEWORK_MAP`) with valid tests for frameworks that are actually mapped (`test_pydantic_detected`, `test_sqlalchemy_detected`, `test_flask_detected`). Also replaced the `test_preserves_insertion_order` test (which assumed insertion order but the implementation returns `sorted()`) with `test_result_is_sorted`, and added a `test_state_param_detected` test plus additional edge case coverage for conventions extraction (numbered lists, deduplication, short bullet filtering).
