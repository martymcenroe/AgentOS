# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a solid foundation for the "Scout" workflow with good attention to cost and privacy. However, strict worktree confinement for output files is not explicitly defined (Tier 1), and standard observability patterns for agents (LangSmith) are missing (Tier 2). These must be addressed before implementation.
