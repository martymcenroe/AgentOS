# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a robust design for the "Scout" workflow with excellent cost controls (strict loop bounds, token budgeting, repo limits). The use of LangGraph and the tiered node structure is well-architected. However, there is a critical Safety oversight regarding the **output path validation** and **overwrite protection** which must be addressed before implementation.
