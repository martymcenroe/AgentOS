# Governance Verdict: BLOCK

The LLD provides a robust design for the "Scout" external intelligence workflow. It impressively handles the critical safety concern of path traversal and privacy gating for internal code transmission. However, the design lacks explicit Observability details (tracing and debug logging) which are high-priority requirements for Agentic workflows.
