# CLAUDE.md - Mock Repository

This is a mock repository used for testing codebase context analysis.

## Rules

- Use snake_case for all module and function names
- PascalCase for class names
- All public functions must have docstrings
- Never use wildcard imports

## Conventions

- Use `poetry run python` for all execution
- Never use bare `pip install`
- Prefer absolute imports from package root

## Style

- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Use black for code formatting

## Constraints

- All state dicts must use TypedDict definitions
- Node functions must accept and return dict
- Tests must use pytest with fixtures in conftest.py
```
