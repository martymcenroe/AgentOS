The file already exists and has content. The task says "DO NOT MODIFY (already scaffolded)" for this file. The test failures shown are from `tests/test_issue_401.py` which contains TDD RED scaffold tests - those are expected to fail until the actual implementation code is written. The `README.md` fixture file is already properly scaffolded.

The file is already complete at `C:\Users\mcwiz\Projects\AssemblyZero\tests\fixtures\mock_repo\README.md` with appropriate mock content for testing. No changes needed.
